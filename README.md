# Real_Time_Digit_Sense
# Project Overview
RealTimeDigitSense is a deep learning project utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for real-time digit classification. This project applies advanced image processing and neural network techniques to classify digits from live video feed accurately.

# Features
Real-time digit recognition from video feed.
Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
Data augmentation for robust training.
Efficient image preprocessing for enhanced model performance.
Interactive prediction display in the video feed.

# Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV for image processing.
Keras and TensorFlow for model building and training.
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

# Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone [repository link]
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To use this project:

Run videocapture.py to start the real-time digit classification.
The script will open a window displaying the video feed with recognized digits.

# Model Training
The model is trained on a custom dataset. Training involves:

Image preprocessing and data augmentation.
CNN model training for digit classification.
Evaluating model performance with accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
The training script siniflandirma.py contains all the necessary steps for model training.
